-- Voxel world mode: THE GEN 3 PALING PROFILE -- a fence stated as posts.
--
-- Hand-authored by this mod and read only from here.  Nothing below is
-- extracted, derived or copied from the ROM; nothing here reaches gameplay,
-- collision, warps, scripts or encounters.  An entry can only ever change
-- how a cell LOOKS.  It is the Gen 3 counterpart of the `figures` and
-- `mounted` blocks in data/voxel_heights.lua and it is a separate file for
-- the same reason data/gen3_terraces.lua is: an authored SHAPE matched per
-- tileset is a different kind of statement from a class table.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY A FENCE HAS TO BE MODELLED AND CANNOT BE CARVED
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Six measured refusals stand behind this file and every one of them was
-- right (NOTES.md g3-railrun-264, g3-post-265, g3-postrun-266, g3-rail-267
-- (a) and (b), and g3-rank-263 before them).  The short form:
--
--   * MauvilleCity's property line round the Game Corner renders as a FLAT
--     BROWN STRIP on its north-south arms -- 130 px^2 of standing surface
--     for three cells -- while its east-west arms render as a proper march
--     of posts.  One fence, one tileset, two answers.
--   * The difference is not positional and it is not a recoverable 8px unit.
--     It is that `Gen3.classAt`'s scenery carve admits 657 (east-west) and
--     refuses 648/650 (north-south) on a `solid < 0.35` ceiling, so the
--     north-south arms fall to `wall`, `buildVolume` founds a run over them,
--     and `ChunkMesher.heightAt` reads the run before the tile's own shape.
--   * Every exact derivation of a better ceiling from the drawing leaks:
--     409 metatiles / 3,395 cells for "splits into two identical 8px halves
--     on one axis", 390 metatiles / 3,485 cells for "one 8px half is exactly
--     empty", 618 four-connected runs over 31,230 cells for "a byte-identical
--     role row implies a shared class".
--
-- AND THE REASON THE CARVE CANNOT WIN IS IN THE ART ITSELF.  Emerald draws a
-- fence line TWICE, in two orthogonal views, and the two views say different
-- kinds of thing:
--
--   metatile 657, the EAST-WEST arm, is an ELEVATION.  Its drawn ROWS are
--     HEIGHT.  Two posts stand side by side across the cell with three wholly
--     empty columns between them and four empty rows above them, so a
--     per-pixel carve reading rows as height gets a rank of posts for free --
--     which is exactly why that arm looks right today.
--   metatile 650, the NORTH-SOUTH arm, is a PLAN.  Its drawn ROWS are DEPTH.
--     Two posts stand one BEHIND another down the cell, and because a post is
--     taller than the eight pixels between it and the next one, the two
--     overlap on screen into one unbroken 5px bar.  There is no gap in it to
--     carve, on this map or on Route 117, and slicing it into 8px units and
--     standing each at its own depth would be INVENTING the gaps -- the
--     four-instance "a drawing smeared over a box that was resized" failure
--     in its purest form.
--
-- The mod has exactly two readings of a drawn row -- "height" (the standee
-- branch of `Structures.buildObject`) and "depth" (its `plan` branch, and
-- `buildRelief`) -- and a receding fence needs a THIRD: the drawn row is
-- DEPTH, and the object's HEIGHT is drawn somewhere else in the same tileset.
-- That third reading is what this file states.  It is not a classifier and it
-- has no threshold in it; it is a figure with the two drawings named.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT AN ENTRY SAYS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   post   the POST, authored: `w` across the line, `d` through it, `h` tall.
--          This is the only invented number in the file and it is small: the
--          width and the height are read straight off the face drawing (five
--          columns, eleven rows, below), and the depth is read off the plan
--          drawing's own post head.  A log is round, so its plan is a disc
--          and only its width is ever drawn.
--   face   THE ELEVATION the post's four side faces wear: the metatile that
--          draws this fence face-on, the drawn COLUMN its west post starts
--          at, and the drawn ROWS that are the post's body.  Drawn row `y1`
--          is the post's foot and `y0` its head, mapped 1:1 onto world y --
--          one drawn row per world unit, never repeated, never stretched.
--   top    THE PLAN the post's lid wears: the metatile that draws this fence
--          receding, and the corner of the `w` x `d` rect that is one post's
--          drawn head.  This is the round cut end of the log, which is drawn
--          nowhere else.
--   pieces metatile -> the list of POST ORIGINS inside the 16x16 cell, as
--          {x, z} in cell-local pixels.  This is the whole placement, and it
--          is where the five-instance "a Gen 3 cell is TWO tile rows and TWO
--          tile columns" trap lives: a cell of fence carries TWO posts, not
--          one, and a piece that lists one post is a piece where the drawing
--          shows one.
--
-- Anything not listed in `pieces` is not a paling and this file never looks
-- at it.  There is no predicate here and nothing is inferred from `solid`,
-- from a role row, or from a behaviour byte.

  -- FENCES THAT LIVE IN A **PRIMARY** TILESET
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  --
  -- A Gen 3 pair is `TILESET_<primary>_<secondary>`, and a metatile below 512
  -- belongs to the PRIMARY -- so it is the same drawing in every pair built
  -- on that primary.  The Mauville log paling above is a SECONDARY fence: its
  -- pieces are 640..698, they exist in one pair, and they appear on three
  -- maps.  The white rail fence below is a PRIMARY fence: its pieces are
  -- 306..330, they belong to gTileset_General, and they appear on FIFTEEN
  -- maps in every pair built on `03DF704`.  Keying it per pair would mean
  -- listing forty-odd pair ids and would silently miss the next one; keying
  -- it on the primary is the fact itself.
  --
  -- Swept over all 518 maps, every map that places any of these twelve
  -- metatiles has primary `03DF704` and no other -- so this table cannot
  -- reach a pair where the same ids mean something else.
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- OVERHEAD FIGURES: art on a cell's ABOVE-PLAYER layer that belongs to the
  -- object standing in the cell IN FRONT of it.
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  --
  -- (g3-crown-278.)  Emerald draws anything taller than one cell across TWO
  -- cells: the body in the cell you stand next to, and the part that rises
  -- past the top of that cell on the ABOVE-PLAYER layer of the cell behind.
  -- The mod already stands the body -- that is the sprite carve, and
  -- g3-planter-269 brought the Game Corner's pots down onto the carpet -- but
  -- the upper half stays painted flat on the wall it was drawn over, because
  -- `Gen3.bakeLinear` composites layer 1 and layer 2 into one tile and the
  -- wall wears that tile.
  --
  -- WHY THIS IS AUTHORED AND NOT DERIVED, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS FINAL.
  -- g3-frond-277 scored every run cell in Hoenn that carries above-player art
  -- -- 3,537 cells on 197 maps -- by BANDINESS, `n2 / (occupied rows x 16)`,
  -- which is exactly "is every row this art occupies a FULL row?" and is what
  -- separates a wall band from a thing standing against it.  A mode at
  -- exactly 1.00 and then a ramp with NO GAP ANYWHERE.  The sharpest extra
  -- clauses available leave 245 cells on 81 maps, and the crown is in the
  -- densest part of that: metatile 559 scores 0.736, the SAME to four
  -- decimals as BattleFrontier_BattleFactoryLobby's wall band, in a bucket
  -- that also holds FortreeCity_Gym's 26 wall light fittings and the two
  -- cable car stations' window brackets.  Every cut that admits the plant
  -- strips Fortree Gym.  So the cells are NAMED, and no discriminator is
  -- needed at all.
  --
  -- WHAT AN ENTRY SAYS, and it is three metatile ids and nothing else:
  --
  --   meta   the cell whose ABOVE-PLAYER layer carries the figure.
  --   under  what that cell wears once the figure is lifted off it.  It must
  --          be `meta`'s own LAYER 1 and the loader CHECKS THAT AT RUNTIME,
  --          pixel by pixel: `under` composited must equal `meta` composited
  --          everywhere `meta`'s above-player mask is clear, and `under` must
  --          have no above-player art of its own.  A figure that fails is
  --          dropped rather than half-applied, so a wrong id here leaves the
  --          wall exactly as it is instead of painting a hole in it.
  --   south  how many cells FORWARD the body stands.  1 everywhere so far:
  --          Emerald's overhead art always belongs to the cell in front.
  --
  -- EVERY OTHER NUMBER IS MEASURED FROM THE OBJECT IT STANDS ON.  The
  -- figure's height, its depth band and the drawn rows it occupies are read
  -- at build time from the standee already in `S.objectQuads` for the cell in
  -- front and from the above-player mask itself -- so the crown cannot drift
  -- from the pot it sits on, and a declared height cannot drift from a drawn
  -- extent.  (The crown's own rows 0..2 are fully transparent; nothing states
  -- 13 anywhere, it is what the mask measures.)
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- HULLS -- one drawing a map lays down TWICE, overlapping, as one block
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  --
  -- (g3-ketch-280.)  Emerald draws a tall thing across several cells, and it
  -- will happily draw TWO tall things across one block of cells when they
  -- overlap -- a second copy of the same art, offset, with the near copy
  -- painted over the far one.  Read cell by cell that block is unreadable:
  -- its masks come back nearly solid and the classifier calls it terrain.
  -- Read as a whole it is completely legible, because the offset is exact.
  --
  -- A figure here states three things and nothing else:
  --   `art`    the UNOCCLUDED drawing, as a block of metatiles.  Its outer
  --            frame must be background (open water, an empty floor), which
  --            is what makes the silhouette exact instead of a threshold.
  --   `block`  the COMPOSITE the map lays down, as a block of metatiles.
  --   `copies` where the drawing sits inside that composite, in DRAWN ROWS
  --            and columns, front-most last.
  --
  -- The pass rebuilds the composite's silhouette from the atlas and refuses
  -- the figure unless it is EXACTLY the union of the drawing at those
  -- offsets, texel for texel.  So `copies` is a claim that gets checked, and
  -- a wrong number leaves the map as it is rather than smearing a boat.
  --
  -- `depth` is the body's thickness in voxels.  5 is `PINNED_DEPTH.prop` --
  -- what the pinned pool already gives the unoccluded placements of this
  -- same drawing -- and it is here so the pair matches its own siblings, not
  -- because anything in the drawing states a depth.  NOTHING in the drawing
  -- states a depth: see the pass's own comment on the single view.

  -- BASINS -- A FOUNTAIN IS A RING IN PLAN, AND ITS PLAN IS WHAT IS DRAWN
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  --
  -- (g3-basin-311.)  MOTIVATED BY THE WATER FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF
  -- RUSTBORO CITY -- RustboroCity (27..29, 38..40), the 3x3 island of paving
  -- in the square outside the Pokemon Center.  Nine metatiles, laid once each,
  -- and it renders today as a lumpy low slab: the height field over its six
  -- tile columns reads 16 16 32 32 16 16 with four SKIP tiles along its south
  -- edge, on a street that is itself 16.  A kerb one course high with a bite
  -- out of one corner, and no water in it anywhere.
  --
  -- WHY THIS IS AUTHORED, AND WHY THE PREVIOUS REFUSAL WAS RIGHT TO REFUSE.
  -- The object crosses all nine cells and its edge is a CURVE that cuts them
  -- diagonally, so no per-cell height class can describe it -- a class gives
  -- one height to a whole cell, and the corner cells are part fountain and
  -- part street.  That refusal asked for four numbers Emerald does not state,
  -- and those four numbers are now supplied; they are the only stated numbers
  -- in this figure and each is marked STATED below.  Everything else is
  -- DERIVED, measured off the drawing, and the measurements are here.
  --
  -- THE DRAWING IS A PLAN, AND IT IS AN EXACT OCTAGON.  Composited over the
  -- nine metatiles the art is a 48x48 block; carved against this map's own
  -- floor colours (Gen3.shapeDataForMap) its silhouette is:
  --
  --     rows  0.. 1   nothing
  --     row      2    x 11..36      the north edge, 26 across
  --     rows  3..11   widening one pixel a side a row   the north chamfers
  --     rows 12..33   x  1..46      the east and west edges, 22 rows
  --     rows 34..45   narrowing one pixel a side a row  the south chamfers
  --     row     45    x 13..34      the south edge, 22 across
  --
  -- and the octagon `|x-23.5| <= 22.5 and |z-23.5| <= 22.5 and the two summed
  -- <= 34` reproduces rows 2..33 of that TEXEL FOR TEXEL -- THIRTY-TWO of the
  -- forty-four drawn rows, both north chamfers and both straight sides, every
  -- one EXACT.  It differs nowhere else except by FORESHORTENING, and by one
  -- pixel at the north edge and two at the south: the near kerb's own front
  -- face is the one place in this drawing where a row is height rather than
  -- depth, and it costs the plan two rows out of forty-four.
  --
  -- So the refusal's "the art is a PLAN, not an elevation" is exactly right
  -- and is the reason this works: a plan is what a ring wants.  What could not
  -- be done was to put a plan through a per-cell height class.  Stating the
  -- plan as a polygon and standing it costs no classifier and no threshold.
  --
  -- WHAT AN ENTRY SAYS:
  --
  --   block    the metatiles the figure is drawn on, as a w x h block, row
  --            major.  The pass requires all of them, laid in that shape, and
  --            builds nothing anywhere they are not.
  --   outer    the kerb's OUTER plan, as a half-extent and an L1 (diagonal)
  --            limit about the block's own centre.  Both DERIVED above.
  --   inner    the water's plan -- the same octagon inset by the kerb's width.
  --   jet      the spout's plan radius, about the same centre.
  --   kerb     how high the kerb stands on the street.  STATED.
  --   water    where the water surface sits.  STATED.
  --   crown    where the jet tops out.  STATED.
  --   face     the moulding PROFILE: one drawn column and the drawn rows that
  --            are the kerb's front face, read bottom-up, one drawn row per
  --            world pixel.  Same contract as a paling's `face`.
  --   lip      the drawn rows that are the INSIDE of the kerb, above water.
  --   plume    the drawn rows that are the jet's own body.
  --
  -- Every horizontal surface -- the kerb's top, the water, the jet's crown --
  -- wears the drawing's own texel at that plan position, 1:1, because the
  -- drawing IS the plan.  Nothing is stretched and nothing is repeated; the
  -- one exception is called out in Structures.buildGen3Basins and is a single
