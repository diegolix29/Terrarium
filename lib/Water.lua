-- Voxel world mode: the water surface.
--
-- Water in this mode has been a flat quad with a scrolling texture: the
-- tileset's own animated tile, recessed two world pixels so the shoreline
-- shows a lip. That is the 2D game's water standing on its side -- the
-- picture moves and the surface does not.
--
-- Out here the surface is geometry, so it can move for real:
--
--   SWELL     Y = f(XZ) only -- watertight unindexed mesh, two crossing
--             trains + body-size field + crest steepening under energy.
--   SIZE      how big the water under a point actually is, measured off the
--             map rather than guessed from a sine (lib/WaterBody.lua). Both
--             the amplitude and the WAVELENGTH ride it, so a fountain gets
--             short shallow ripples and a sea gets a long swell, out of the
--             same two trains and the same row setting.
--   SPARKLE   analytic normal (two cosines), cel-quantized glint rings.
--   BODY      rain / snow / freeze / wind / thermal inertia / chop energy
--             that lags the weather, so the surface has mass.
--
-- Still a four-colour diorama: hard steps, checker dither, three varyings
-- (vWater, vWave, vSwellH), identity only `y < -1`. No mesh attribute, no
-- second RT, no normal map, no soft airbrush.
--
-- SURFACE ART (optional drop-in): put a PNG at `assets/water/water.png` and
-- lakes / rivers sample it in world XZ instead of the tileset's water tile.
-- Same contract as assets/ground/: replace the file and it is used; delete
-- it and the tileset art comes back. No constant, no rebuild.

-- ------- THE SPECTRUM: three trains of FIXED length, and nothing else
--
-- The size of a body of water used to shorten the wave by scaling the wave
-- VECTOR: `a = (k . x) * bf(x) - phase`. That reads like the obvious thing to
-- do and it is not, because the gradient of that argument is
--
--   grad a = bf * k  +  (k . x) * grad bf
--
-- and the second term is a product of WORLD POSITION -- unbounded, thousands
-- of pixels across a route -- with the shoreline ramp, which is nonzero at
-- every bank in the game. Measured at the bank of a test lake
-- (tests/water_disperse_glint_offline.lua): the local wavenumber is 1.14x the
-- one the wave should have at the world origin, 7.80x a thousand pixels out
-- and 28.03x four thousand out. Past about a thousand pixels the perturbation
-- is larger than the wave it perturbs, which is not a shorter wave -- it is
-- noise with a period, drawn along every shoreline far from the origin.
-- Watertightness never caught it: Y = f(XZ) stays perfectly continuous while
-- the pattern underneath it comes apart.
--
-- So no wave vector is a function of position any more. There are three
-- trains, their lengths are constants, and WHAT THE SIZE OF THE WATER MOVES
-- IS HOW LOUD EACH ONE IS. A weight multiplies a sine; it does not live
-- inside one. grad a is exactly k, everywhere, forever.
--
-- LONG and MID are the old pair at the open-water end of the old ramp
-- (WAVE_A0 * SIZE_FREQ_BIG and WAVE_B0 * SIZE_FREQ_BIG), so open water comes
-- out of this bit-identical in space to what it was. SHORT is new and is what
-- a puddle actually gets: a third direction at 2.3x the wavenumber, which is
-- the short end the old ramp was reaching for.

-- two directions crossing or it stops reading as water.

-- nothing and it is the second crossing direction the smallest water needs.
-- The open sea keeps NONE of the short chop: at |k| 0.183 that train is a
-- fifth of a display pixel per cycle at this camera, which under a nearest
-- upscale is not detail, it is the frame-to-frame churn the shimmer probe was
-- built to hunt. So the sea comes out of this bit-identical to what it was.
Water.MIX_FLOOR_LONG = 0.10
Water.MIX_FLOOR_SHORT = 0.0
Water.MIX_KNEE = 1.40    -- how fast the crossfade runs across the size ramp

-- DISPERSION. 1 = a wave's tempo follows its own length, 0 = the old single
-- clock. Kept as a knob because it is the one change in this file that moves
-- every body of water at once and an ablation is the only honest way to rank
-- it (tests/water_physics_probe.lua flips it).
--
-- The wave VECTOR is scaled by bodyFreq (see below) and the phase never was,
-- so the crest of a short wave travelled at `rate / (k * bf)` -- inversely
-- with bf. A puddle, whose bf is 2.3, crawled at less than half the speed of
-- the open sea, which is why small water read as an ocean filmed in slow
-- motion rather than as a puddle. Deep-water gravity waves disperse as
-- `omega = sqrt(g * k)`, so the speed falls as `1 / sqrt(k)` and not as
-- `1 / k`: multiply the phase by sqrt(bf) and the ratio is right.
--
-- ADVECTION IS DEDUCTED FROM THIS DELIBERATELY -- it is scaled by nothing.
-- The advection term grows without bound with world position (0.045 * energy
-- * dot(xz, current) is ~84 rad four thousand pixels out), so multiplying it
-- by a quantity that varies across the map would put tens of radians between
-- one bank and the other and tear the surface apart. The current drags the
-- whole ocean at one speed; only the wave's own tempo knows how long it is.
--
-- IT IS SAFE ONLY BECAUSE THE WAVE VECTORS ARE CONSTANTS. The first attempt
-- at this scaled the phase by sqrt(bf(x)) with bf still a field, and that put
-- `phase * grad sqrt(bf)` into the gradient -- a spatially varying quantity
-- multiplied by a clock that does not stop growing. Measured at a lake bank:
-- 1.01x the wave's own wavenumber at twelve seconds and 42.9x at one hour.
-- With fixed vectors each train's tempo is a CONSTANT SCALAR, the same number
-- everywhere on the map, and it contributes nothing to any gradient at all.
--
-- The ratios are taken from the REST vectors and never from the live ones.
-- refreshLive stretches all three together with wind and energy, and a tempo
-- ratio that moved with it would make `time * rate` jump by `time * d rate`
-- every time the weather turned -- an hour into a session that is a large
-- number of radians. The stretch is common to all three, so leaving the
-- ratios on the rest lengths costs nothing and removes the failure.
Water.DISPERSE = 1.0

-- Tempo of each train relative to the LONG one: omega ~ sqrt(k), so a short

-- `floor(s * 4 + 0.5)` was 0 on every fragment of every lake. The rings were
-- not rare, they were unreachable; the effect had never once been visible
-- outside dawn and dusk, where a low sun stretches |sunRay.xz| enough to
-- limp into the first ring.
