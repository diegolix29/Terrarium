-- Voxel world mode: THE GEN 3 ARM.
--
-- Everything this mod knows about building Hoenn as geometry lives here, and
-- nothing outside this file needs to know Gen 3 exists beyond asking
-- `Gen3.forMap(map)` and getting nil back on Kanto and Johto.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY GEN 3 IS NOT "GEN 2 WITH DIFFERENT ART"
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The mod's Gen 1 and Gen 2 paths spend most of their effort inferring, from
-- pixels, three things the drawing does not state: what a cell IS, whether the
-- player passes in front of it or behind it, and how high the ground under it
-- sits.  Gen 3 states all three outright, and the whole point of this file is
-- to stop guessing where the cartridge already answered.
--
--   BEHAVIOUR BYTE   one per metatile, out of the attributes word.  240
--                    named values: tall grass, deep water, a ledge you jump
--                    SOUTH over, an animated door, a counter, a bookshelf,
--                    ice, a floating log, a bridge over the ocean.  Gen 2's
--                    equivalent is a collision class with about a dozen
--                    meanings and no vocabulary for furniture at all.
--
--   LAYER TYPE       one per metatile, also out of the attributes word.  A
--                    Gen 3 metatile is drawn in two halves and the layer type
--                    says which background each half goes to -- which is to
--                    say whether the top half is drawn ABOVE the player
--                    (cover: a treetop, a roof, the upper storey of a house)
--                    or BELOW them (a second course of ground: a carpet over
--                    a floor, a path over grass).  That is exactly the
--                    question `Structures`' background flood exists to guess
--                    at on Gen 1 and Gen 2, and here it is a field.
--
--   ELEVATION        one per CELL, in the map's own blockdata.  Gen 2 records
--                    no height whatsoever -- a terrace and the grass below it
--                    are both collision $00, which is why the Johto profile
--                    has to recognise terraces by their FLOOR ART.  Gen 3
--                    hands over the Y axis directly, and it is what puts
--                    Route 110's cycling road over the sea rather than in it,
--                    and what gives Sootopolis its crater.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE ONE STRUCTURAL COINCIDENCE THAT MAKES THIS CHEAP
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- A Gen 3 METATILE is 16x16 pixels and IS one collision cell.  A Gen 1/Gen 2
-- CELL is also 16x16 -- 2x2 of the 8px tiles the mesher works in.  So the
-- mesher's tile grid, its cell arithmetic (`math.floor(tx / 2)`), its 8px
-- side-band courses, its ambient occlusion and its whole run machinery are
-- ALREADY the right shape for Gen 3.  Only two things differ:
--
--   * a Gen 3 BLOCK is 2 tiles on a side, not 4 (`def.width * 4` is wrong);
--   * there is no tile id -- there is a metatile id, and the sheet is 16x16
--     CELLS rather than 8x8 tiles.
--
-- The second is answered by a SYNTHETIC TILE ID, and this is the load-bearing
-- trick of the file:
--
--     tileId = metatileId * 4 + quadrant,  quadrant = (ty % 2) * 2 + (tx % 2)
--
-- One metatile becomes four 8px tiles in the mesher's own numbering, in
-- reading order.  Every consumer that treats a tile id as an opaque number
-- keeps working untouched; only the UV lookup has to know, and it is one
-- function.  Nothing else in the mod acquires a Gen 3 branch.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* DONE HERE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- There is no second mesh for the "above player" layer, and that is a design
-- decision rather than an omission.  Drawing a treetop over the player is a
-- two-dimensional trick for depicting height on a flat map.  In a diorama the
-- treetop is simply UP, and the depth buffer does the rest.  So the two baked
-- sheets are composited into ONE atlas for texturing, and the top layer is
-- read instead as a HEIGHT SIGNAL: a metatile whose top half is drawn above
-- the player is a metatile with something standing on it.

-- HOW THIS FILE REACHES THE ENGINE, and the mistake worth not repeating.
--
-- `_G.Game` IS NIL IN A REAL SESSION.  The engine's Game is a module, reached
-- with `require("src.core.Game")` -- which is what every other file in this
-- mod does -- and it is not published as a global.  Reading `_G.Game` cost
-- both halves of the Gen 3 arm at once and neither said so clearly:
--
--   * `gen3WorldFor` was never found, so the engine seam looked absent even
--     on a host that publishes it, and the mod fell back to baking the pair
--     itself;
--   * and the fallback then could not find `Game.data.map_tilesets` either,
--     so it reported "no map_tilesets entry for primary TILESET_03DF704" --
--     which reads like missing DATA and is really a missing lookup.
--
-- `_G.Game` is kept as a second choice purely so the headless tests, which
-- have no `src.core.Game` to require, still work.

-- ELEVATION -> WORLD HEIGHT
--
-- The raw value is NOT a height.  Emerald's levels are labels, not rungs: a
-- map uses whichever of 0..15 it needs and skips the rest, so Sootopolis runs
-- 0,1,3,4,5,7,9 and Fortree runs 0,3,4,15.  Reading the number as a course
-- count would put a 96px cliff where Sootopolis draws two, and a 192px one
-- where Fortree draws a rope bridge.
--
-- So RANK them.  Collect the levels a map actually uses, sort them, and let
-- consecutive ranks be one course apart.  Two neighbouring terraces are then
-- always exactly one course apart, which is what the art draws, whatever
-- numbers the cartridge happened to label them with.
--
-- The four reserved values keep their meanings:
--
--   0  TRANSITION   "compatible with any level".  The tempting reading is
--                   "a ramp", and the tempting rule is "take the highest
--                   neighbour, because a transition is the surface you are
--                   stepping onto".  Both are wrong, and the map data says
--                   so plainly: elevation 0 tracks the BLOCKED cells almost
--                   exactly -- Fortree 560 zeroes against 546 blocked cells,
--                   Sootopolis 2079 against 2091, Rustboro 1033 against 1096,
--                   Route 119 2794 against 2963.  It is overwhelmingly the
--                   marker on scenery nobody can stand on, not on ramps.
--
--                   So a blocked transition cell takes the DATUM and nothing
--                   more -- its real height is measured from its art by
--                   `Structures.buildVolume`, which also reads the ground it
--                   is founded on off the flat cell in front of it.  Only a
--                   PASSABLE transition cell is a genuine ramp, and it takes
--                   the LOWEST real level around it: a ramp read high puts a
--                   shelf at the bottom of the slope, which is a step you can
--                   see, while a ramp read low is a step at the top that the
--                   terrace above it already hides.

--

-- and FireRed ships behaviour bytes Emerald has no name for.  DERIVED, over

-- with no row at all, so every one of them falls to the STRUCTURAL answer
-- (blocked -> `wall`, passable -> `ground`; see classAt below).
--
-- Most of those 37 are right there and are deliberately left alone: the
-- Rocket Hideout spin tiles are passable floor, Route 17's cycling road is
-- passable road, and a painting, a poster, a blueprint or a wall phone IS
-- part of the wall it hangs on.  Three are not, and the worst by a wide
-- margin is the sea:
--
--   IN-GAME LOCATION: SEAFOAM ISLANDS B3F/B4F and the SEVII PORTS -- Three
--   Island Port, Four Island, Two Island, Navel Rock, Birth Island.  DERIVED:

-- script NAME: a byte that moves in a future re-import arrives here for free,
-- and no Kanto number is written into Lua anywhere in this mod.
--
-- AND EMERALD IS NOT TOUCHED.  Emerald's cache has no `gen3FRLGBehaviours`
-- key at all, so the overlay is never built there and `spec()` answers the
-- file on disk, the same table object it always did.

--
-- Keyed on the pokefirered EventScript NAME.  A name with no row here is one

--
-- HOW THE HEIGHTS WERE CHOSEN.  `Structures.JOINERY_H` derives its own
-- heights off the LAYOUT: "Emerald draws a fridge over TWO map rows (560 the
-- upper door in the wall band, 568 the carcass in the front row), and a row
-- is one 16px cell, so the picture is 32 world pixels of object".  The same
-- reading, taken on FireRed over all 425 maps, is what picks between 32 and
-- 16 below -- for each cell carrying the byte, how many of the 16 pixel rows
-- of the WALL-BAND cell above it differ from that row's own plain-wall
-- metatile (so: how far the drawing rises out of its own cell).
--
-- Two signals that were expected to help did NOT, and saying so is part of
-- the measurement.  DERIVED: the ABOVE-PLAYER layer (`Gen3.artOf(...).n2`,
-- the signal classAt's own furniture rule uses to tell a face-on `prop` from
-- a top-down `tabletop`) is ZERO on every cell of every byte below except 2
-- of 0xCD's 52 -- FireRed draws its interior furniture entirely on the
-- below-player layer, so it separates nothing here.  And the carved
-- silhouette runs the full cell (top row 0, bottom row 15) on 100% of the
-- cells of every furniture byte, because these are wall units that fill
-- their 16px: that separates nothing either.  The wall-band reading above is
-- the one that does.

--
-- `ctx.roleAt`'s stair arm reads "banded art that fills its cell and draws
-- no face", and it separates a flight from Slateport's decking and Route
-- 114's rock on `solid` and `face`.  It cannot separate a flight from an
-- INDOOR PLANK FLOOR, because a plank floor is honestly all three things:
--
--   Sootopolis 580/581   banded  cap 16  face 0  solid 1.00   a flight
--   Littleroot 513/517   banded  cap 16  face 0  solid 1.00   floorboards
--
-- Every number the test has is identical.  Brendan's house reported SEVEN
-- flights in one room, all of them flat, and the room was meshed as steps.
--
-- What separates them is not the tile, it is the SHAPE OF THE RUN, and two
-- readings settle it, both structural rather than chosen:
--
--   THE PLAYER IS ONE CELL WIDE.  A flight is something you walk up, so
--   Emerald draws one one or two cells across.  Over all 518 maps, 527 of
--   the 538 connected runs of tread art are at most two cells across:
--
--     cells across   1 -> 494    2 -> 33    3 -> 2    4 -> 5    5..7 -> 4
--
--   A WIDE FLIGHT IS A CHANNEL CUT THROUGH SOMETHING.  Mt Pyre's grand
--   stairs are three cells across -- the two runs in the game that are --
--   and every cell flanking them, down both sides, is blocked: they are cut
--   into the mountain.  A room is not.  The eleven runs three or more cells
--   across separate with nothing in between:
--
--     MtPyre_Exterior      3x3, 3x4     flanks blocked 1.00   FLIGHTS
--     FortreeCity_House1-5 8x4          flanks blocked 0.81   floors
--     Littleroot houses    6x7 .. 10x7  flanks blocked 0.40-0.55
--
-- So: a run of tread art at most two cells across is a flight; a wider one
-- is a flight only if it is cut on EVERY flanking cell.  213 cells on nine
-- maps stop being stairs -- the four Littleroot starter-house floors and
-- the five Fortree tree-hut floors -- and nothing else in Hoenn moves.

  -- --- what a cell IS ------------------------------------------------------

  -- THE STRUCTURAL RULE, and the reason the behaviour table can be as short
  -- as it is.  Most of Hoenn is MB_NORMAL: a house wall, a tree trunk, a
  -- cliff face and the road in front of them all carry the same byte, because
  -- the byte answers "what kind of surface" and not "is this solid".  Three
  -- facts decide the rest, and Gen 3 states all three:
  --
  --   1. the BEHAVIOUR, where it has an opinion (water, grass, a ledge, a
  --      counter).  A stated answer always wins.
  --   2. the CELL's collision bit -- passability, which in Gen 3 lives on the
  --      map rather than on the tileset.
  --   3. the metatile's LAYER TYPE, which says whether its top half is drawn
  --      above the player.  Above-player art on a BLOCKED cell is cover: a
  --      treetop, a roof, the upper storey of a house.  That is the signal
  --      `Structures`' background flood spends its whole existence inferring
  --      from pixels on Gen 1 and Gen 2.
  --

  -- that combination is tall grass you stand IN, or the shadowed cell under
  -- an overhang, and raising either one would put the player inside a box.

  -- SCENERY THE BEHAVIOUR BYTE DOES NOT NAME.
  --
  -- Built once per map, lazily, because it needs NEIGHBOURS and `classAt`
  -- only ever sees one cell. Emerald's border forest is not a tree drawing
  -- with a silhouette around it -- it is a 2x2-metatile motif tiled edge to
  -- edge across whole columns of the map (468/469 over 476/477 in Littleroot,
  -- the same shape in every other town's palette). Read cell by cell that is
  -- a green wall, and a green wall is what the mesher built: the "trees are a
  -- tiled green mass" in the report.
  --
  -- Read as a TILING it is a stand of trees, and the right un-projection is
  -- one round crown per 2x2 block -- which is what `canopy` means to
  -- `Structures.buildCylinders`: a 32px hull carved over four cells, anchored
  -- at the top-left, its partners marked `cylinder`. Tiled across a forest
  -- that gives a field of overlapping crowns instead of a hedge, and a lone
  -- tree in a garden gets a single 16px hull rather than a box.
  --
  -- Row-major greedy is deliberately the whole algorithm. It anchors at the
  -- top-left of every mass, which is where Emerald's own motif starts, and a
  -- mass with an odd width or height simply ends in single-cell crowns --
  -- correct-looking either way, and no alignment to guess at.
  -- THE BORDER RING COUNTS. A Gen 3 map is surrounded by its border patch
  -- tiled outward, and in Hoenn that patch is almost always the SAME forest
  -- motif as the map's own edge -- which is most of the trees anybody
  -- actually sees, because the ring is what fills the horizon. Scanning only
  -- 0..width-1 left every one of them a flat green box standing beside the
  -- round crowns inside the map, which reads worse than if neither had been
  -- carved. `blockedAt` answers solid off the map and `metatileAt` border-
  -- extends, so the same rules work out here with no special case.

    -- over an EXCLUSIVE grid, so the first tree to reach a shared cell takes
    -- it and the second forms no square at all: it falls through to the

    -- Measured: those two cells sit in a blocked run of 32 -- the whole north
    -- wall of the room -- and the carve lathed them anyway.  A lathed cell
    -- leaves the wall's height band and meshes at the ground its stamp stands

    -- A RAIL IS NOT A WALL.
    --
    -- Outdoors the carve separates these as cleanly as it separates furniture
    -- indoors, and for the same reason: a wall's art fills its cell, while a
    -- fence, a rail, a chain-link run or a low kerb is a thin thing with the
    -- ground showing through and around it. Measured on Rustboro, whose
    -- streets are lined with them, the rails carve to 0.19-0.26 solid against
    -- a wall's 1.00 -- four fifths of the cell is ground -- and every one of
    -- them was meshing as a full-depth block sixteen pixels through.
    --
    -- Foliage and anything with above-player art are excluded: a hedge is a
    -- hull and an awning is a structure, and both can be thin.
    -- A RAILING STANDS ON GROUND.  A ROCK RIDGE IS THE GROUND'S EDGE.
    --
    -- The carve above is necessary and not sufficient.  Sootopolis is paved
    -- in white stone and its crater ridges are drawn as olive bands winding
    -- over that paving; the band's colour is also a ground sample, so the
    -- ridge carves to the same fifth of a cell a Rustboro rail does.  492
    -- cells of the town -- metatiles 721/728/730/731/732/736/738 -- meshed as
    -- railings and stood across every street in the low-angle shot.
    --
    -- The drawing separates them without ambiguity.  A rail is an object ON a
    -- surface, so its cell still draws that surface: measured over the game's
    -- outdoor tilesets, every rail with more than a handful of cells --
    -- Rustboro's 792/793/538, Slateport's 322/320/307, Mauville's 690/689,
    -- Verdanturf's 846/944/803 -- is `surface` art with a cap of 12 to 16 and
    -- NO front face.  A ridge, a brow or a bank has no cap at all (cap 0 or 1)
    -- and a face of 2 to 16, because it IS relief rather than something
    -- standing on it.
    -- ...AND NOT WHERE THE CARTRIDGE HAS ALREADY NAMED THE ROCK.
    --
    -- The pixel test above is a statement about a THIN thing with ground
    -- showing round it, and `solid` is measured against the map's own floor
    -- colour -- so a cell drawn IN that floor's colours reads thin because it
    -- IS the floor.  Route 114's and Route 115's rock tops are exactly that:
    -- gTileset_Fallarbor's 577, 572, 571, 569 and 595 are pale speckled stone
    -- on pale speckled ground, `surface` art with cap 16 and no face, and they
    -- measure solid 0.09 to 0.32 -- inside the railing window, and cap 16 /
    -- face 0 passes the cap test trivially.
    --
    --     Route114  843 cells of 577 alone, 675 of the map's 3,200
    --     Route115  363 cells
    --     1,038 cells region-wide, on those two maps and no others
    --
    -- Meshed as `fence` each one is a 10px THIN slab with the ground left
    -- showing round it (TileShape.THIN), so the mountain is a field of low
    -- bars you see daylight between rather than a mass -- the same twelve
    -- cells g3-sculpt-220 found cut clean through the ridge at (36,29) and
    -- (37,28).
    --
    -- The cartridge settles it in one byte.  MB_MOUNTAIN_TOP is Emerald's own
    -- word for the top of a rock mass; not one railing in Hoenn carries it,
    -- and every rail this carve exists for -- Rustboro's 792/793/538,
    -- Slateport's 322/320/307, Mauville's 690/689 -- is MB_NORMAL.
    --
    -- In-game location: Route 114's north-west and north-east rock flanks and
    -- the ridges of Route 115.
    -- MAUVILLE'S LOG FENCE IS ONE OBJECT AND THIS GATE CUTS IT IN FOUR.
    -- (g3-rank-263 -- measured against the user's own 2D/3D pair of
    -- MauvilleCity and NOT shipped.  Read this before widening the gate.)
    --
    -- The cartridge draws the property line round MauvilleCity's Game Corner
    -- as one log fence, and every arm of it is the SAME 8px round-topped
    -- post repeated -- TWO POSTS PER GEN 3 CELL, one per tile, which is the
    -- five-instance "a cell is two tile rows and two tile columns" trap.
    -- Metatile 650/648 (the north-south arms) draw the post twice down the
    -- cell, exactly 8px-periodic (`rows2` = 5,5,5,5,7,8,7,6 twice over);
    -- 657 (the east-west arms) draws it twice ACROSS, columns 1..6 and 9..14
    -- identical; 689/690 are the same drawing with the last post given its
    -- base row, and 640/642 the same with a cap.
    --
    -- One fence, and it leaves this file as FOUR classes:
    --
    --   657   E-W arms   solid 0.40  cap 5 face 3   -> cliff    h 32
    --   650   N-S arms   solid 0.38  cap 16 face 0  -> wall     h 16
    --   689   end post   solid 0.29  cap 16 face 0  -> fence    h 10
    --   690   end post   solid 0.29  cap 16 face 0  -> fence    h 26
    --   642   cap post   solid 0.51  cap 5 face 3   -> cylinder h 16
    --
    -- 648/650 and 689/690 have BYTE-IDENTICAL role rows -- surface, green,
    -- cap 16, face 0, motif true -- and are 4-connected in a straight line.
    -- The only thing between them is `solid`, 0.38 against this carve's
    -- `< 0.35`, and the frame shows what that costs: the north-south arms
    -- fall to `wall`, `foundGen3Buildings` gives them a run, and each arm
    -- draws as ONE CONTINUOUS 16px STRIP down the property line with the
    -- `cylinder` cap sitting on its end as a round disc -- "a felled log".
    -- The east-west arms are claimed by the sprite carve instead and come
    -- out RIGHT, a march of separate posts, from the same drawing.
    --
    -- WIDENING THE GATE IS NOT THE FIX, twice over.  0.35 -> 0.40 is fitting
    -- a constant to two metatiles, which this project does not do; and
    -- `fence` would not repair the frame anyway -- `TileShape.ART.fence` is
    -- `upright`, a box, so the arm would still be a strip, only 10 or 26px
    -- tall instead of 16.  A fence that reads as posts needs the drawing's
    -- 8px unit to become the drawn unit, and nothing in this file works at
    -- 8px.  That is the next reading, and it is a class, not a threshold.
    --
    -- MEASURED, so the obvious worry can be dismissed: MauvilleCity's 95
    -- `cylinder` cells are NOT the fence.  87 are trees (metatiles 198, 22,
    -- 14, 199 -- role `tree`, leafy, solid 0.78..1.00), 6 are the round
    -- bushes along the path (664/666, spaced two cells apart), and exactly
    -- TWO are fence: the north caps 640 and 642.  The fence can never
    -- become 95 lathes.
    --
    -- AND THE FENCE CANNOT BE REPAIRED BY MAKING ITS RUN ONE CLASS EITHER.
    -- (g3-railrun-264 -- measured over all 518 maps and NOT shipped.)
    --
    -- The tempting invariant is "a 4-connected run of blocked cells with a
    -- byte-identical role row should share a class", since 648/650 (`wall`)
    -- and 689/690 (`fence`) have identical rows and are in one straight
    -- line.  Hoenn violates it 618 times on 134 maps, over 31,230 cells,
    -- with run lengths from 2 to 3,978 and no mode anywhere -- and only 29
    -- of those runs involve a fence at all.
    --
    -- A ROLE ROW IS ABOUT THE MATERIAL AND A CLASS IS ABOUT THE OBJECT;
    -- data/gen3_metatiles.lua says so in its own header ("Asked of a
    -- metatile, 'is this a cliff' has no answer").  The three rows doing
    -- nearly all the merging are `surface/water/0/0` -- Underwater Route
    -- 128's whole 3,978-cell seabed -- `face/rock/0/16` -- Ever Grande's
    -- 1,331-cell rock -- and `surface/green/16/0//true`, which is EVERY
    -- TREE AND EVERY FENCE POST in the general tileset at once.  The
    -- commonest split of the 618 is `canopy` against `cylinder`, 243 runs
    -- and 12,749 cells, and that is exactly the distinction g3-crown-242
    -- and g3-lathe-250 exist to make.
    --
    -- Nor can the winner be ordered from the role table: 27 runs carry
    -- three classes or four (MtPyre_Exterior, 1,041 cells, is
    -- cliff/signpost/wall/water in ONE run).  Take the majority and the
    -- winner is `cylinder` on 229 runs and `cliff` on 175 against `fence`
    -- on 9 -- and MauvilleCity's own fence run is 32 cells of which 28 are
    -- TREES, so this property line would come out as a row of lathes.
    --
    -- Measured separately, because it is the thing worth knowing: even a
    -- PERFECT class here does not un-weld the fence.  With the carve
    -- widened so the whole north-south arm resolves to `fence`, every cell
    -- takes the same height and the arm is one continuous box again --
    -- vertical surface 1,614 -> 2,670 px^2 on the (6,14..18) arm, 1,224 ->
    -- 2,824 on (14,12..18).  A taller strip, not posts.  The welding is
    -- adjacent equal-height boxes; the run founding is not the culprit and
    -- refusing `foundGen3Buildings` a run on a `fence` line would be a
    -- no-op, since no `fence` cell in the 81 outdoor maps carries one.
    -- The fence needs the drawing's 8px unit to become the drawn unit, and
    -- that is a class, not a classifier tweak.
    --
    -- ...AND THAT CLASS WAS DESIGNED, MEASURED AND REFUSED TOO.
    -- (g3-post-265.  Two independent reasons; read both before trying it.)
    --
    -- FIRST, THE UNIT CANNOT BE DERIVED WITHOUT LEAKING.  The exact test --
    -- the cell's post-carve opaque mask splits into two identical 8px halves
    -- on exactly one axis, neither half empty nor full -- fires on 409
    -- metatiles over 3,395 cells across all 72 tilesets: 280 of them `wall`,
    -- 56 `cliff`, 15 `tabletop`, 12 `cylinder`, and only 11 `fence`.
    -- Interior art is drawn in 8px modules, so shelf fronts, window bands
    -- and railings all qualify.  Nothing separates them: the fill fraction
    -- of the 409 runs 0.008 to 0.984 in a smooth ramp, `wall` spans the
    -- whole of it, and the fences (0.188 .. 0.328) sit inside the wall
    -- range with wall metatiles at 0.062, 0.125, 0.188, 0.250, 0.312 and
    -- 0.344 interleaved among them.  Conjoining `railStands` does not save
    -- it either -- metatile 657, the one arm of Mauville's fence that
    -- currently draws RIGHT, fails `railStands` on `face = 3`.
    --
    -- SECOND, AND WORSE: ON THE AXIS THAT IS BROKEN THE 8PX UNIT IS NOT A
    -- POST.  Read off the carved atlas, the two arms of the same fence:
    --
    --   657, east-west, ALREADY CORRECT     650, north-south, THE DEFECT
    --     row  4 |..###.....###...|           row  0 |.........#####..|
    --     row  9 |.#####...#####..|           row  5 |........########|
    --     row 14 |..###.....###...|           row 11 |.........#####..|
    --     cols   0 9 11 11 11 9 0 0 ...       cols   0 x8 4 16 16 16 16 16 8 4
    --
    -- 657 has THREE FULLY EMPTY COLUMNS between its two posts and four
    -- fully empty rows above them: each 8px column is one whole post with
    -- background all round it, which is exactly why the per-pixel sprite
    -- carve already draws that arm as a march of posts.  650 is ONE
    -- UNBROKEN BAR -- columns 9..13 occupied in all sixteen rows -- and its
    -- 8px period is post-tops EMBOSSED on a continuous rail.  Emerald draws
    -- a receding fence that way because you cannot see between posts that
    -- stand one behind another.
    --
    -- So there is nothing in the north-south drawing to cut on.  g3-rank-263
    -- established that a rank is periodic only where there is BACKGROUND
    -- between its units; the east-west arm has that background and the
    -- north-south arm has none.  Slicing the bar into 8px units and standing
    -- each at its own depth would be inventing the gaps, which is the
    -- four-instance "a drawing smeared over a box that was resized" failure
    -- in its purest form.
    --
    -- ...AND ROUTE 117 SHOWS WHAT RIGHT LOOKS LIKE, WHICH CHANGES THE ANSWER.
    -- (g3-postrun-266.  Read this before acting on the paragraph above.)
    --
    -- Route117 draws the same fence CORRECTLY out of this same tileset, and
    -- the reason is neither positional nor a recovered 8px unit.  It is a
    -- different METATILE landing on the other side of this carve's own
    -- ceiling:
    --
    --   Route117 north-south fence  320 / 322  solid 0.328  -> `fence`
    --   Mauville north-south fence  648 / 650  solid 0.375  -> `wall`
    --
    -- `classAt` answers identically for the same metatile on both maps (648
    -- is `wall` on Route 117 too), so nothing about the town is doing this.
    -- What the miss COSTS is a run: 648/650 fall to `wall`, a run is founded
    -- over them (n=30 f=35 h=16 at Mauville (6,15..17)), and `heightAt`
    -- reads the run before the shape.  Measured on the fence cells alone:
    --
    --   Route117 (8,14..16)  fence, no run   30 horiz quads, 90 vert / 2,572 px^2
    --   Mauville (6,15..17)  wall + run      12 horiz quads, 14 vert /   130 px^2
    --
    -- 130 px^2 of standing surface for three cells of fence is the flat
    -- brown strip in the report.  And 320/322 are the SAME UNBROKEN BAR as
    -- 650 -- columns 2..5 occupied in all sixteen rows -- so the paragraph
    -- above stands: the correct rendering is not obtained by cutting an 8px
    -- unit, because Route 117 has no 8px unit either.
    --
    -- CORRECTION TO g3-railrun-264: its probe (this ceiling widened to 0.45)
    -- was read as "one class welds into a taller strip" off a window that
    -- included the terrain beside the fence.  On the fence cells alone the
    -- probe moves Mauville TOWARDS Route 117 -- 12 -> 30 horizontal quads,
    -- which is Route 117's figure exactly, one top face per drawn cell
    -- instead of one run drawn once, and 130 -> 1,074 px^2 of standing
    -- surface.  The measurement was right; the conclusion drawn from it was
    -- not, and it would have sent the next reader away from the answer.
    --
    -- WHAT STILL BLOCKS IT is this ceiling and nothing else.  Every exact
    -- derivation of it from the drawing leaks: "a wholly empty 8px half-cell
    -- AND the drawing repeating at 8px on the other axis", the tightest form
    -- there is, admits 132 metatiles over 1,182 cells -- 72 `wall` and 26
    -- `cliff` against 11 `fence`, including building corners at solid 0.996
    -- and 1.000.  And 0.35 -> 0.45 is a constant fitted to two metatiles.
    -- The gate wants a statement about what a RAIL is that `solid` is not
    -- making.  TWO CANDIDATES HAVE NOW BEEN MEASURED AND BOTH FAIL
    -- (g3-rail-267); do not re-derive them.
    --
    -- ASYMMETRY RATHER THAN DENSITY.  320 and 650 are mirror images -- a
    -- dense 8px half and a wholly empty one -- so 0.328 and 0.375 are the
    -- same drawing at two offsets and any ceiling between them cuts a line
    -- that is not there.  The right shape of statistic is therefore the
    -- RATIO of the fuller 8px half to the emptier, and over all 5,056
    -- blocked metatiles it is genuinely bimodal, with a true gap:
    --
    --     1.00-1.25 2953   2-4 547   8-16 55   64-999   0
    --     1.25-2     860   4-8 131   16-64 13  INFINITE 390
    --
    -- Nothing between 16 and infinity.  It still cannot be used: the 390
    -- with an exactly-empty half cover 3,485 cells and are wall 176,
    -- cliff 91, water 42, FENCE 32, ledge 23 -- cliff edges and ledges,
    -- with rails at eight percent -- and their fill fractions overlap
    -- completely (fence 0.094..0.328 inside wall 0.004..0.500).  A
    -- statistic can be bimodal and still select the wrong thing.
    --
    -- (And a correction to g3-postrun-266, which reported wall leakers "at
    -- solid 0.996", impossible for a metatile with an empty half: it printed
    -- `Gen3.analyse`'s TILESET-level `solid` beside a mask taken from
    -- `Gen3.shapeDataForMap`'s PER-MAP carve.  Two surfaces.  On one surface
    -- the empty-half population tops out at fill 0.500 exactly.)
    --
    -- REFUSING THE RUN RATHER THAN RECLASSIFYING.  The damage is the run,
    -- not the class, so the smaller claim is "a cell whose metatile has a
    -- wholly empty 8px half may not found a building run".  Enumerated over
    -- all 518 maps: 3,169 run-carrying tiles on 165 maps would lose one --
    -- wall 2,585, cliff 453, shell 118 -- led by MagmaHideout_4F 245,
    -- MagmaHideout_1F 171, NewMauville_Inside 153, Underwater_Route128 99,
    -- AquaHideout_B1F 89, SootopolisCity 69 (51 of them crater cliff) and

    -- Half the caves and hideouts in Hoenn lose their walls to repair one
    -- property line.
    --
    -- WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK is a MODEL rather than a carve: a fence line
    -- stated as posts (`buildFigures`-style, the machinery that already
    -- matches authored SHAPES per tileset) with the rail drawing used as
    -- TEXTURE rather than as silhouette.  That is an authoring job, not a
    -- classifier, and it is the only reading left standing.

    -- WHERE THE LINE GOES, AND WHY IT IS DRAWN AT A CAP OF ONE.
    --
    -- The obvious threshold is the one the real rails sit at -- cap 12 to 16
    -- -- but Sootopolis' Mart is painted in blues the lake also uses, so the
    -- analyser reads its roof (metatiles 619/620/621) as 8% drawn, `brow`,
    -- cap 1, face 1.  That is character for character the ridge metatile 721,
    -- and no pixel statistic separates them.  A cap of 12 throws the shop's
    -- roof out with the ridges and the Mart meshes as a pale slab.
    --
    -- So the line is drawn at "has ANY cap and draws no face": it keeps every
    -- real rail (Rustboro 792/793 cap 16, 538 cap 12, 800 cap 1; Slateport
    -- 322/320 cap 16; Mauville 689/690 cap 16), keeps the Mart, and still
    -- takes 412 of Sootopolis' 492 false railings -- 728, 730, 731, 732, 736
    -- and 738, every one of them cap 0 with a face of 2 to 16.  721 is the
    -- one ridge piece that survives, and it survives because the cartridge
    -- draws it exactly like a shop roof.

    -- ...AND KANTO DRAWS ITS FENCES SOLID, SO THE CARVE CANNOT SEE THEM.
    --
    -- MOTIVATED BY PALLET TOWN'S FENCE, (5..8, 11) and (13..18, 16), and by
    -- every fence in Kanto behind it.  The carve above asks whether the
    -- ground shows THROUGH the cell, which is true of Hoenn's wire rails
    -- (0.19-0.26) and false of Kanto's, which are drawn as a solid row of
    -- posts under a rail: metatile 231 measures 0.70 and Pallet's 644 a flat
    -- 1.00.  Both are far outside the window, so every one of them fell
    -- through to `cliff` and meshed as a row of upright slabs -- a line of
    -- filing cabinets across the grass, which is the report.
    --
    -- The cartridge's own description separates them, in the same two bytes
    -- the note above already reads.  It says a rail is "`surface` art with a
    -- cap of 12 to 16 and NO front face", and relief "has no cap at all
    -- (cap 0 or 1) and a face of 2 to 16".  Kanto's fence is NEITHER: it is
    -- `brow` with a cap of 2 or 3 and a face of ONE -- a low thing that
    -- turns over near the top of its drawing and shows a single pixel row of
    -- front below it.  `cap > face` is the whole statement: relief has more
    -- wall than top by construction, and a rail has more top than wall.
    --
    -- ...AND IT IS A LINE, NOT THE EDGE OF A MASS.  Nothing is blocked north
    -- or south of a fence cell.  Without that clause Cerulean's terrace
    -- walls -- 681, 684, 689, which carry the same `brow, cap 3, face 1` --
    -- came in with it and would have been cut into bars.
    --
    -- MEASURED over every outdoor map: 649 cells on 26 FireRed maps, and

    -- INDOOR FURNITURE, from the floor showing around it.
    --
    -- A room's blocked cells are the walls AND everything standing in it, and
    -- the behaviour byte separates none of them: 94% of every indoor blocked
    -- cell in the game resolved to generic `wall`, which is why the tables,
    -- the PCs and the televisions were all boxes.
    --
    -- The carve separates them, and the reason it can is simple: a WALL fills
    -- its cell -- there is no floor to see past it -- while a table, a chair,
    -- a television or a plant is an object standing ON the floor, so the
    -- floor shows around it and the cell carves partly away. That is the
    -- whole test, and it needs this map's own floor to work (see
    -- Gen3.shapeDataForMap).
    --
    -- Which WAY the object is drawn decides its shape, and Emerald states
    -- that too. Art on the above-player layer is drawn face-on and standing
    -- against a wall -- a television, a PC, a bookcase, a fridge -- so it
    -- becomes an upright whose picture is its FRONT face, which is what puts
    -- a screen on the front of the box instead of lying on its lid. Art with
    -- nothing above the player is a surface seen from above -- a table, a
    -- counter, a bed -- and rides the top face at table height.
    if not ctx.outdoor then
      -- FURNITURE IS A DISCRETE OBJECT; A WALL IS A RUN.
      --
      -- The carve alone is not enough. A room's back wall is decorated --
      -- panelling, a window, a poster -- and some of that decoration is drawn
      -- in colours the floor also uses, so the wall carves partly away and
      -- reads like an object standing on the floor. Taken cell by cell, the
      -- Pokemon Center's entire fourteen-cell north wall came out as a row of
      -- tables.
      --
      -- What separates them is EXTENT. A table, a plant, a television, a bin
      -- is a handful of cells with floor all around it; a wall is a long
      -- connected run that lines the room. So the furniture rule only applies
      -- inside a small blocked blob, and the walls -- which are the big ones
      -- -- stay walls.
      local FURNITURE_MAX = 8
      -- ...AND A THING STANDING AGAINST THE WALL IS STILL A DISCRETE OBJECT.
      --
      -- MOTIVATED BY THE SS ANNE'S CABIN BEDS, SSAnne_2F_Room1..3 at (4, 3)
      -- and the eight like them, and by AGATHA'S PILLARS in the League.
      --
      -- `EXTENT` above is the right idea with one blind spot: a bed, a
      -- pillar, a bookcase or a bin is pushed BACK AGAINST THE WALL, so the
      -- flood fill walks straight into the wall and the blob becomes the
      -- room's whole lining -- far past FURNITURE_MAX.  Every one of those
      -- objects was skipped and left as `wall`, which is a 16px cube: the
      -- cabin beds stood nearly to the ceiling with the mattress on the lid,
      -- hiding the pictures on the wall behind them.
      --
      -- The exception is the one `lone` already makes for a town sign, which
      -- stands in front of the building it names: EAST, WEST AND SOUTH OPEN
      -- makes it an object, and the cell behind may be blocked provided it is
      -- a DIFFERENT metatile, so a wall's own corner or a returning jamb
      -- cannot pass.  A wall is a RUN -- it always has a blocked neighbour
      -- east or west -- so no length of wall can reach this.
      --
      -- MEASURED with `tools/obj_audit.lua` over all 943 maps at
      -- g3-rail-346: 114 indoor cells in FireRed and 107 in Emerald were
      -- lone objects still shaped as blocks, and this limit is what held
      -- them out.
      --
      -- WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS NOT A BUG, and it cost an hour to establish:
      -- a cell this rule hands to `tabletop` often ends up
      -- `class = "ground", art = "flat"` in `S.shapeAt`.  That is
      -- `buildGen3Joinery` taking the piece over -- it draws the bed as its
      -- own quads and leaves the cell as the floor the piece stands on,
      -- recording `joinery = "tabletop"` on the record it writes.  The
      -- object is there; the class is bookkeeping.  Read the render, not the
      -- class.
      -- ...AND A PIECE MAY BE DEEPER THAN ONE CELL.
      --
      -- MOTIVATED BY THE SAME CABIN BED.  It is TWO cells: (4, 2) is the
      -- head, with the pillow and the headboard, and (4, 3) is the foot.
      -- "South open" admits only the southernmost cell of a piece, so the
      -- foot became furniture at 12px and the head stayed `wall` and was
      -- sculpted by another pass to a stepped profile topping out at 8 --
      -- MEASURED off the mesh, horizontal faces at 12.0 against 8.0.  One
      -- bed at two heights, with its foot standing proud of its pillow.
      --
      -- So the test walks SOUTH: a piece may run a few cells deep provided
      -- it stays ONE CELL WIDE the whole way and the far end opens onto the
      -- floor.  A wall cannot use this -- it is refused at the first step,
      -- because a wall run has a blocked neighbour east or west -- and a
      -- wall stub two cells deep is refused by the north clause, its own

    -- A FENCE IS A DRAWN FACE THE GROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF IT SHARES.
    --
    -- The `cliff` arm at the bottom of `roleAt` is a catch-all -- anything
    -- blocked, drawn with a face or in a hard material, that no warp claims
    -- -- and Hoenn stands a great deal ON its ground that this swept up as
    -- the edge BETWEEN two grounds: the Safari Zone's pen walls, Route 110's
    -- cycling-road guard rails, the kerb round a flowerbed, a rock chip on a
    -- sandbank.  Every one of them was `cliff`, and `cliff` is a BOUNDARY --
    -- `isBoundaryRole` walks it and the terrace raster charges a course for
    -- every wall a crossing passes through.
    --
    -- The Safari Zone's north-east pen is where it shows.  Its 401 `cliff`
    -- cells go with only 43 `shelf` -- a ratio of 0.11 against Jagged Pass's
    -- 1.17, Route 111's 2.4 and 1.2-4.4 everywhere else -- so almost none of
    -- that rock has a drawn TOP behind it.  The field climbed one course per
    -- wall crossed and reached 96px over 886 cells, and g3-settle-231, which
    -- capped the climb, had to book 226 of those walls as "a cliff separating
    -- nothing", which is exactly what a fence IS and what the vocabulary had
    -- no word for.
    --
    -- The map-level ratio cannot classify a cell.  Its per-cell form can, and
    -- it is four readings of one drawing:
    --
    --   1. THE CELL DRAWS NO TOP OF ITS OWN.  `cap == 0`.  A cell that turns
    --      over from surface to wall is the lip of a step and keeps it.
    --   2. THE SAME GROUND STANDS ON BOTH SIDES OF IT.  Walk out through the
    --      rock along each axis -- the same walk `capGen3Rock` makes, and to
    --      the same depth a wall is ever drawn -- and the first walkable cell
    --      each way must exist and be drawn in the same material.  A cliff
    --      has ground on ONE side and mass on the other, or two DIFFERENT
    --      grounds: Route 111's mesa is rock over sand.
    --   3. NOTHING AROUND IT DRAWS A TOP EITHER.  No lip (a metatile with
    --      both cap and face), no blocked rock surface, and no cell that is
    --      blocked with no walkable neighbour -- which is `roleAt`'s own
    --      definition of `shelf`, asked of the neighbourhood instead of the
    --      map.  This is the shelf-to-cliff ratio made local.
    --   4. THE CARTRIDGE SIGNS NO DROP WITHIN REACH.  A LEDGE is Emerald's
    --      own signed statement that this edge is a drop you may hop, and a
    --      STAIRCASE that it is one you may climb; where either is within
    --      three cells of the wall through the rock, the drop is real however
    --      the face is drawn.  Ledges are the currency `GEN3_RELIEF_GATE`
    --      already prices relief in.
    --   5. AND IT HAS NO BODY: no two-by-two square of landscape contains it.
    --      A wall is a line; a mass is an area.
    --
    -- What a fence then IS to the rest of the model is already written down:
    -- `GEN3_STANDS_ON_GROUND` lists `fence`, so it takes the floor beside it;
    -- `isBoundaryRole` does NOT, so no crossing charges a course for it; and
    -- `asLandscape` below keeps its drawn class `cliff`, so the mesher builds
    -- exactly the wall it built before.  It stands, it is rock, it casts its
    -- shadow -- it just does not lift the ground behind it.
    --
    -- In-game location: the Safari Zone's north-east and north pens, whose
    -- rock walls divide one flat field into forty; Route 110's cycling road,
    -- where the guard rail runs along the deck; and Route 130's crags, which

      -- the six columns of a gate house were thrown away, and the second

      --
      -- Where the door column has already stated a roofline there is nothing

    -- Everything above this line founds a building FROM A WARP.  The loop is

    -- this block NO DOOR AND NO WARP -- all twelve of Rustboro's warps are
    -- elsewhere and none is inside its footprint -- so it was never a
    -- candidate, `ctx.buildings` claimed none of its 28 cells, and it fell
    -- through to the generated landscape role table, which reads its
    -- metatiles as `cliff` and `shelf`.  `capGen3Rock` then gave its columns
    -- "the drop they separate": 16 and 32 side by side over a street at 16.
    -- A four-by-seven building drawn as at most one course of pavement, which
    -- is the flat block in the report.  The house across the street, which

    -- street.

    -- WHAT THE CARTRIDGE STATES ABOUT IT is the one thing this function
    -- already trusts a door to lead it to: "A roof is the one thing Emerald
    -- states plainly (`roofAt`: the top half drawn above the player, filling
    -- the cell), so where the door column has one, the facade starts at it."
    -- Row 40 of this mass -- (31,40) to (34,40), metatiles 566/574/574/567 --
    -- is drawn on the ABOVE-PLAYER layer at solid 1.00, and `ctx.roofAt` is
    -- true on all four.  The building states its own roof.  Only the door is
    -- missing.
    --
    -- So: a SECOND founding pass, after the warp pass, over the blocked
    -- masses the warp pass did not claim, admitting one only on evidence the
    -- warp pass already trusts.  A mass is a building if

    --     one door column;
    --   * the footprint is a FILLED RECTANGLE -- a house is a box;
    --   * it is at least two cells in BOTH axes -- a box has two dimensions;
    --   * the whole ring outside it is WALKABLE -- it stands free in a
    --     street, so it is not a fragment of a mass and not a face that
    --     retains ground;

-- THE TEXTURE
--
-- ONE sheet, and this is a design decision rather than a shortcut.
--
-- Gen 3 bakes a pair into TWO sheets because the flat game draws them either
-- side of the player: the bottom half is what you walk in front of and the
-- top half is what you walk behind.  That split is a two-dimensional trick
-- for depicting height on a map that has none.  A diorama has height, and a
-- depth buffer -- a treetop drawn over the player on the GBA is simply UP
-- here, and the geometry puts the player behind it without being told.
--
-- So the two sheets are composited into one texture and the top layer is read
-- instead as a HEIGHT SIGNAL: a metatile whose top half is drawn above the
-- player is a metatile with something standing on it (Gen3.classAt).  The
-- alternative -- a second mesh with its own texture drawn after the character
-- pass -- would reproduce the flat game's draw order faithfully and look
-- wrong from every camera angle except straight down.
--
-- Composited on the GPU from the engine's own baked sheets rather than
-- re-baked on the CPU, so the diorama and the flat map can never disagree
-- about what a metatile looks like.  Once per pair, cached.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE ATLAS IS RE-LAID AS AN ORDINARY 8px TILE SHEET.
--
-- This is the most useful thing in the file, and it is a layout change rather
-- than a rendering one.
--
-- Gen3Tiles composites a pair into a sheet of 16x16 METATILES. Everything in
-- this mod that makes a SHAPE -- the tree hulls, the roof massing, the
-- per-pixel props, the void test, grass, flowers, relief, bookcases -- reads
-- the atlas as a grid of 8x8 TILES at `(t % perRow) * 8`, in sixty-three
-- places across Structures and Buildings. Two incompatible layouts, and the
-- consequence was not a wrong picture but NO SHAPE AT ALL: `Structures.pixels`
-- answered nil on Gen 3, every one of those passes is gated on `if data then`,
-- and all of them quietly skipped. Every tree and every house fell through to
-- a plain measured box. That is the "everything is boxy" report, entire.
--
-- So instead of teaching sixty-three sites a second layout, the sheet is
-- emitted in the layout they already speak: metatile `m` quadrant `q` lands at
-- synthetic tile id `4m + q`, and tile `t` sits at `(t % 16) * 8` across and
-- `floor(t / 16) * 8` down -- exactly where a Gen 1 tile id would put it. The
-- four quadrants of a cell are always four CONSECUTIVE tiles in one row
-- (4m mod 16 is always 0, 4, 8 or 12), so nothing ever straddles a row.
--
-- Adjacency in the sheet carries no meaning to any of these passes -- they
-- compose shapes from `map:tileAt`, never from where two tiles happen to sit
-- next to each other -- which is what makes the relabelling safe.
--
-- The transform runs inside the plot callback, so there is no intermediate
-- buffer: Gen3Tiles hands out metatile-sheet coordinates and they are mapped
-- to tile-sheet coordinates on the way past.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT A METATILE IS A PICTURE OF.
--
-- Measured on a real Littleroot, the behaviour byte resolves the WHOLE MAP to
-- three classes: wall, ground, water. Not one tree, roof, fence, sign or
-- flower -- because Emerald writes MB_NORMAL on the trees, the houses, the
-- roofs, the fences and the signs alike. The byte answers "what kind of
-- surface is this", and scenery is not a kind of surface. Gen 1 and Gen 2 get
-- away without such a byte because this mod reads their ART; on Gen 3 the art
-- was the one thing nothing looked at, so every object in Hoenn meshed as the
-- box its collision bit implied. That is the boxiness, entire, and no amount
-- of hand-pinning seventy-four tilesets would have fixed it.
--
-- So: read the art. Two facts about a Gen 3 metatile make this far easier
-- than the Gen 1 equivalent.
--
-- ONE. EMERALD DRAWS AN OBJECT ON LAYER 2 OVER THE GROUND ON LAYER 1. A house
-- roof metatile's bottom layer is plain grass -- pixel for pixel the same
-- grass as the empty field beside it -- and the roof is the top layer, drawn
-- with real transparency around its edges. So for everything drawn that way
-- the SILHOUETTE ALREADY EXISTS; the composite is what destroys it, by
-- painting the two layers into one opaque sheet. Splitting them back out is
-- all the outline detection a roof, an awning, a sign or a fence needs.
--
-- TWO. THE GROUND COLOURS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. Because layer 1 under a full
-- layer-2 object is by construction ground, the set of ground colours can be
-- read off rather than guessed at: take the layer-1 palette of every metatile
-- whose top layer is nearly full, and that is the tileset's own answer to
-- "what does the floor look like here" -- grass in the fields, sand on the
-- beach, rock in a cave, floorboards in a house. No colour constants, no
-- greenness heuristic, nothing to retune per tileset.
--
-- Those two together give the SHAPE SURFACE: the same bake as the texture
-- atlas, except that a layer-1 pixel painted in a ground colour, with no
-- layer-2 art over it, is written TRANSPARENT. Every pixel pass in Structures
-- and Buildings tests alpha to find background -- `a == 0 and "off"` -- so
-- with that one change the tree hulls, the roof massing, the per-pixel props,
-- the void test, grass, flowers and relief all start seeing real outlines on
-- Gen 3 instead of a wall-to-wall opaque rectangle that carves to nothing.
--
-- The texture atlas stays fully opaque. These are two surfaces on purpose:
-- one is what the world is painted with, the other is what its shape is read
-- from, and a hole in the first is a hole in the ground.

-- a palette colour, as an exact key -- Gen 3 art is indexed, so equality is
-- exact and there is no distance threshold to pick
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- IS THIS PIXEL FOLIAGE?  ONE READING, USED TWICE.
--
-- The two tests that decide whether a drawing is a canopy were written out
-- twice with the same constants, and the second of them says so in its own
-- words: "which is the foliage signature used everywhere else in this file".
-- They have to agree -- one protects a canopy from being swallowed into the
-- seamless background, the other decides whether the carve lathes it into a
-- crown -- and a canopy that passes one but not the other is either dissolved
-- or left as a box.  So it is named once here and called twice.
--
-- GREEN AGAINST BLUE IS THE LOAD-BEARING CLAUSE, AND IT IS UNTOUCHED.  Hoenn's
-- ground grass is 0.46/0.77/0.65 and its canopy 0.39/0.67/0.33, so
-- `g > b * 1.35` separates grass from tree with a wide margin on every outdoor
-- tileset in Hoenn (STATED: the measurement this rule shipped with, quoted at
-- its second call site).
--
-- GREEN AGAINST RED IS ONLY "IS IT GREEN AT ALL", AND THE OLD 1.10 WAS TOO
-- TIGHT FOR KANTO.  MOTIVATED BY THREE ISLAND'S BERRY FOREST, where 1,597 of
-- 2,679 cells -- 59.6% of an outdoor map -- meshed as `wall`, which outdoors
-- is the class that hands the cell to the building-run machinery expecting a
-- founded run to cover it (see `roleAt`'s own note, and "where no run comes
-- ... the cell is drawn at nothing"): a forest with no buildings, drawn at
-- nothing.  The four SAFARI ZONE maps ran 15-19%.  Region-wide FireRed was
-- 2.96% against EMERALD'S 0.88% -- DERIVED, all 425 and all 518 maps.
--
-- THE CAUSE IS ONE PALETTE, AND VIRIDIAN FOREST IS THE CONTROL.  Kanto draws
-- the SAME canopy metatile ids in both forests -- 656/657/658/664/665/666/
-- 672/673/674 -- out of two different secondary tilesets, and Berry Forest's
-- (S02D5004) is a sunlit YELLOW-green where Viridian's (S02D4DC4) is not:
-- id 665 reads (222, 218, 109) there, so green sits a hair BELOW red and the
-- old ratio refused it, while Viridian's same id reads green on all 256 of
-- its pixels.  Nothing about the drawing differs; only the colours do.
--
-- 0.95 IS THE MIDDLE OF THE GAP RATHER THAN A NUMBER FITTED TO IT.  Berry
-- Forest's canopy sits at g/r 0.98, Viridian's at 1.73 and Hoenn's canopy at
-- 1.73, so nothing that was already foliage comes near the threshold from
-- above; and whatever 0.95 newly admits must still clear `g > b * 1.35`,
-- which Hoenn's grass (g/b 1.18) fails outright.

--

-- `bakeLinear` plots layer 1 and then layer 2 into one synthetic tile, which
-- is right for a renderer and wrong for the one question an authored overhead
-- figure has to ask -- WHICH PIXELS ARE THE THING IN FRONT rather than the
-- wall behind it.
--
-- The Game Corner's potted plants are the case.  Emerald draws each plant
-- across two cells: the crown on the ABOVE-PLAYER layer of the wall cell
-- (metatile 559) and the pot in the cell in front (567).  Metatile 559's
-- layer 1 is byte-identical to 538, the plain wall band beside it, and 538's
-- own layer 2 is EMPTY -- so 538 composited IS 559's wall, and the crown is
-- exactly 559's layer 2.
--
-- WHY NOT SUBTRACT THE TWO BAKED METATILES INSTEAD.  Measured, and it is off
-- by two pixels: the difference between 559's composite and 538's is 151 of
-- the crown's 153, because two of the crown's own texels happen to be drawn
-- in the same colour as the wall pixel behind them.  A silhouette two pixels
-- short is two holes in a leaf, so the layer is read directly rather than
-- inferred from a difference.
--
-- Cheap, and only ever asked once per pair: the sheet is walked once, and
-- only metatiles that HAVE above-player art are kept.  On the Game Corner's
-- pair that is 10 metatiles of 1,120, holding 1,615 pixels in total.

-- the player, which is all a crown hanging on a wall needs.  INDOOR FURNITURE
-- is the other half of the same question and cannot use it: a table's layer
-- type is not the above-player one, so `bakeLayer(2, ...)` -- which goes
-- through `Gen3Tiles:bakeMetatileInto` and only draws when `topIsAbovePlayer`
-- -- plots NOTHING AT ALL for it.  Measured on the Rustboro dining table:
-- `overheadMasks` returns no entry for metatiles 894, 895 or 910.
--
-- WHY ANYTHING NEEDS THIS.  The shape surface (`shapeDataForMap` below)
-- separates object from floor BY COLOUR: it composites the two layers and
-- knocks out every colour the room lays its floor in.  That is right nearly
-- everywhere and wrong wherever Emerald painted an object in one of the
-- floor's own colours -- there the object is carved away WITH the floor.
-- Layer 2 is the same drawing without the colour test: object art is the top
-- layer with real transparency around it, so its own alpha states the
-- silhouette whatever colours it happens to be painted in.  MEASURED on
-- RustboroCity_House1: metatile 895 carves to 16 pixels of 256 and its layer
-- 2 draws all 256, which is the tablecloth the carve cannot see.

-- answer a question this mod asks about a handful of cells per map.  Four 8x8

-- THE ANIMATED TILES, AS PATCHES INTO THE RELAID SHEET.
--
-- THE SEA SOUTH OF ROUTE 104 AND THE FLOWER BEDS IN ITS FIELDS.  In the flat
-- game those move; in the diorama they were a photograph, because this file
-- bakes a pair's art ONCE, caches it by tileset id, and the mesh samples that
-- one texture forever.  The mesh is not the problem and never was -- the
-- geometry of a pond does not change shape when the water moves -- so this
-- does what `TerrainAtlas` already does for Johto's surf shimmer: keep a
-- private copy of the sheet and rewrite the moving slots in it when the step
-- turns over.  No mesh is rebuilt, no UV moves, and SHAPE_REV is untouched.
--
-- WHAT A GEN 3 ANIMATED TILE IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SLOT.
--
-- Gen 1 and Gen 2 animate an ATLAS CELL: water is tile $14, and rewriting
-- that one 8x8 slot moves every pond in the region.  Emerald animates a RUN OF
-- TILE GRAPHICS -- 30 tiles at index 432 for the sea and its shore, 2 at 508
-- for the flowers -- and a single one of those tiles is referenced by 148 of
-- the 862 metatiles in the Route 104 pair.  In this file's relaid layout,
-- metatile `m` quadrant `q` is synthetic tile `4m + q`, so ONE animated
-- cartridge tile becomes several hundred slots in the sheet.
--
-- So the patch is precomputed as STRIPS: one ImageData per step, holding the
-- new 8x8 for every slot that moves, laid side by side.  Applying a step is
-- then `#slots` calls to ImageData:paste -- a memcpy per row inside LOVE --
-- rather than tens of thousands of setPixel calls three times a second.
--
-- A quadrant is included when EITHER of its two layer entries names an
-- animated tile, because the relaid sheet writes layer 1 and then layer 2 into
-- the same slot (bakeLinear does exactly that) and either can be the thing
-- that moves.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE FLOWER BEDS, AND HOW THEY ARE TOLD FROM THE SEA.
--
-- IN-GAME LOCATION: the flower beds in ROUTE 104's fields, north and south of
-- Petalburg Woods -- 22 cells -- and the same beds in Littleroot, Oldale,
-- Petalburg, Rustboro, Slateport, Mauville, Lilycove, Mossdeep, Lavaridge, Mt
-- Pyre's slope, Routes 102/110/111/114/115/118/119/120/121/123, Faraway
-- Island, Southern Island and the Battle Frontier grounds.  In Kanto and
-- Johto those stand up as animated cutouts (Structures.buildFlowers); in
-- Hoenn they were a flat patch of colour painted into the ground, which is
-- the report this exists for.
--
-- WHY NOTHING REACHED THE STANDEE MACHINERY.  `TileShape.forMap` names a
-- flower from `tileset.animatedTiles` / `TileRenderer.defaultAnimatedTiles`,
-- which is the GEN 1/2 animation declaration -- and DERIVED, over the owner's
-- real dataset: 0 of 76 Gen 3 tileset records carry `animatedTiles` at all.
-- So `flowerTiles` is empty on every Hoenn map.  It would not have helped if
-- it were not: `TileShape.at` answers a Gen 3 square from `classAt` below and
-- never reads the tile-level pin at all.  This is where the answer has to
-- come from.
--
-- AND WHY THE ANIMATION RUNS ALONE ARE NOT THE ANSWER.  A Gen 1/2 animated
-- tile IS the flower, because it is a single 8x8 atlas slot.  Emerald
-- animates RUNS OF TILE GRAPHICS, and on the Route 104 pair those runs are
-- tile=432 count=30 (the sea), 464 count=10 (the sand/water edge), 480
-- count=10 (the land/water edge), 496 count=6 (the waterfall) and 508 count=4
-- (the flowers) -- the sea, its two shores, a waterfall and a flower bed, all
-- declared alike.  Standing "an animated tile" up in Hoenn stands up the sea.
--
-- WHAT SEPARATES THEM.  Five readings, DERIVED over all 518 maps and 5,356
-- animated metatiles in the game:
--
--   1. THE BOTTOM LAYER DOES NOT MOVE.  On the sea, the shore and the
--      waterfall, the thing that animates IS the surface -- Emerald draws it
--      on layer 1, the ground the player stands on.  On a flower bed layer 1
--      is still grass and the moving half is drawn OVER it.  DERIVED: this
--      one reading rejects 5,191 of the 5,356.
--   2. THE MOVING HALF REDRAWS THE WHOLE CELL -- all four quadrants, all 256
--      pixels.  A flower BED is a square of field, not a detail stuck in a
--      corner.  DERIVED: rejects a further 111 (Fiery Path's lava sparkles,
--      12 pixels of a cell; the Battle Frontier's fountain lips).
--   3. LAYER TYPE IS `COVERED`.  Emerald's layer type says which background
--      the top half is drawn to, and COVERED means UNDER the player -- so it

  -- the game, this function returned nil for all of them, and the sea south
  -- of Route 104 -- with its shore, and the flower beds in the fields above
  -- it -- has been a photograph in voxel mode ever since.
  --

  -- animatedMetatiles / setAnimFrame / animStep, and those are what is asked

  -- pair -- the very object `bakeLinear` above composites the STATIC relaid
  -- sheet out of (`tiles:bakeLayer(1, plot)`), and the one the engine's own
  -- 2D sheets were baked from.  `Gen3Tiles:setAnimFrame(f)` writes
  -- `self.animFrame`, rebuilds `self.tileOverride` and drops
  -- `self.tileCache`; every later `tilePixels` then reads frame f.
  --
  -- So a strip build that simply walked off the end, leaving the last step
  -- laid over the tiles, would make the NEXT static bake -- the art every
  -- shape pass, every tree hull, every prop and the void test read -- a
  -- picture of that step, with the sea frozen at whatever phase the build
  -- happened to stop on.  The engine leaves this object on frame 0 after
  -- baking (TileRenderer.gen3SheetsFor ends with `tiles:setAnimFrame(0)`)
  -- and it must still be on frame 0 when we are done.
  --
  -- Snapshot the three fields setAnimFrame assigns (derived: they are

  -- left a frame laid over the tiles just the same.  Restoring the ORIGINAL

-- REPORTED from play, alongside the disk cache's own stale hash: "in
-- mauville gym when standing on the tiles that switch the electric fences,
-- they switch spots in 2d but with voxels on they dont move at all".

-- no honest way to move one cell of it.  Cheap to ask for -- a sweep of 90
-- blocks nils one table entry 90 times -- because the rebuild happens once,

--- HOW MANY COURSES OF CLIFF THIS ONE CELL DRAWS: 1 or 0.
---
--- Two things in Emerald's art are each worth a course, and they look nothing
--- alike:
---
---   a LEDGE -- a hard shadow line with masonry above and below it.  That is
---   how Sootopolis draws a worked stone step (577), and the raised body
---   behind it (737) has no such line and is worth nothing.
---
---   a FRONT FACE -- a cell that is nothing BUT the vertical face, which is
---   how the crater's rust wall and Mt Chimney's ash banks are drawn.  There
---   is no shadow line because there is no top edge in the cell at all.
---
--- Counting these up a run is what makes a cliff drawn three faces tall come
--- out three courses tall.
-- A WALL IS NEVER WALKABLE ANYWHERE.
--
-- Sootopolis' pale stone pavement is metatile 729, and the tileset draws it
-- with a lit top edge and a shadow -- which is exactly how it draws a terrace
-- rim, so `metaRole` calls it `brow` and every reader downstream calls it a
-- step.  It covers 894 cells, a quarter of the map, and charged as a step it
-- raises a block wherever it lies: the quilt of little walls around every
-- house in the frame, and the maze of white rock the city renders as.  It is
-- also, at a glance at the 2D art, plainly the ground the town is paved with.
--
-- The cartridge already says which it is, and says it in the one place that
-- cannot be drawn: 607 of those 894 cells ARE WALKABLE.  You cannot stand on
-- the front of a cliff.  A metatile you can stand on in most of the places it
-- appears is ground, and the places it is blocked are blocked by something
-- standing ON it -- a fence, a signpost, a planter -- not because the stone
-- became a wall there.
--
-- Measured across the region, the two populations do not overlap:
--
--     map                metatile   cells   walkable
--     SootopolisCity          729     894        67%   pavement
--     MtChimney               625     636        53%   ash floor
--     Route112                625     268        50%   ash floor
--     RustboroCity            545      16       100%   paving
--     SootopolisCity          113     161        48%   south rim
--     Route116                113     452        14%   rock
--     MtPyre_Exterior         113     270         5%   rock
--     SootopolisCity          737     299         0%   crater wall
--     SootopolisCity          730     126         0%   crater wall
--
-- Every real wall is at or under 14%; every misread ground is at or over 48%.
-- A simple majority sits in the gap with room on both sides, and it is the
-- rule with a reason behind it rather than a threshold picked to fit.
--
-- Deliberately NOT flattened: Sootopolis' southern rim, which the art draws as
-- 617 -> 113 -> 748 -> 721, one metatile per row of terrace.  113 is 48%
-- walkable and stays an edge, which is what keeps those rows stepping -- the
-- fault that counting brows was added to fix.
--
-- In-game location: Sootopolis City, the stone the whole town is paved with,
-- and the same reading leaves its southern rim (rows y=56..59) stepping.

  -- and 724 are `brow` with 6.  So the deepest wall in Hoenn scored zero
  -- courses and the town's relief had to be guessed from its lake instead.
  -- The consequence was measured when terraces were merged across boundaries
  -- the reader scored 0: Sootopolis' flat flights went from 3 of 24 to 11 and
  -- its cliffs separating nothing from 266 to 588, because real walls were
  -- being merged away.
  --
  -- What makes a cell one course is that the tileset paints it as a vertical
  -- face, and that is what the coverage measures.  The label is about how the
  -- face is drawn -- banded, browed, plain -- not whether it is one.  Twelve
  -- of sixteen keeps the threshold where it was: a cell more than three
  -- quarters face is a course of face, a cell that is mostly top surface is
  -- not, and a body cell with no face at all is still worth nothing however
  -- many of them are stacked.

  -- shows it plainly: the Mart's terrace is ringed by `face` art with coverage
  -- 0 at every corner (16,28) (17,28) (18,28), and with the corners uncounted
  -- the boundary round that terrace summed to nothing and the whole shelf sat
  -- flat.  The southern rim is the same fault at scale -- its steps turn
  -- constantly.
  --
  -- The label is the evidence here, not the coverage: a metatile the tileset
  -- calls a FACE is a face however little of the cell it fills.  `banded` still
  -- needs the coverage test, because a staircase's treads are banded and must
  -- not be counted twice -- once as treads and once as faces.

  -- and counting only coverage scored every one of them zero.  Eight rows of

  --
  -- A brow IS a step: it is the top edge of one, which is the whole of what
  -- the tileset draws where two terraces meet without room for a face between

--- above a building into it so the roof can cover the course you walk behind
--- -- Oldale's gold ridge, which was "laid nowhere at all" without it.
---
--- Kanto's houses have such a row too, and it is not a ridge: metatiles

--- The runs come in ragged over it -- Lavender's middle house reads north 18,

-- THE OUTDOOR FLAG.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG.  `Map.isOutdoor(def)` -- a STATIC function, called the same
-- way everywhere in this mod (`Map.isOutdoor(def)`, never as a method on an
-- instance) -- reads Gen 1/Gen 2 `def` fields only (see the header on
-- `Structures.mapMeta` / the "Map.isOutdoor reads three Gen 1/Gen 2 def
-- fields" comment there).  A Gen 3 `def` carries none of them, so it answers
-- "indoor" for every single Hoenn map, town, route and all -- and roughly
-- thirty call sites across this mod gate outdoor-only behaviour on exactly
-- that call: `AmbientLife.update` (butterflies, FIREFLIES, birds, sparrows,
-- dragonflies -- gated at the very top, before any of them ever reach a
-- grass or ground check), `Weather`, `WindFX` leaves, `GroundFX`, `Ecology`,
-- `AmbientSound`, `CityLife`/`StreetLamps` placement, `DayTint`, `Light`,
-- `SkyLayer`/`HorizonArt`/`Backdrop`, `Shelter`, `Interiors`, `WorldAtlas`.
-- Every one of them silently treats Hoenn as one giant interior.  Fireflies
-- specifically never get past `AmbientLife.update`'s own outdoor gate to
-- ever ask a single cell about grass, so the earlier `isGrassCell` fix could
-- never have shown up there -- this is the gate one step before it.
--
-- `Structures.lua` already worked around this FOR ITS OWN MESH PASS
-- (`local outdoor = Map.isOutdoor(def); if gen3 and gen3.outdoor ~= nil then
-- outdoor = gen3.outdoor end`), reading Emerald's own MAP_TYPE out of
-- `data/gen3_maps.lua` instead of trusting the Gen 1/2 heuristic. Every
-- OTHER caller in the mod never got that override, because each one calls
-- the engine's `Map.isOutdoor` directly rather than going through
-- `Structures`.
--
-- THE FIX.  Patch `Map.isOutdoor` itself, once, so every caller gets
-- Emerald's own answer for a Gen 3 map without having to know Gen 3 exists
-- -- exactly the intent of `Structures`' own workaround, just applied at
-- the one shared choke point instead of copied into thirty files.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Emerald's own MAP_TYPE-derived outdoor answer for one map DEF, from
--- `data/gen3_maps.lua`, or nil when this def is not a Gen 3 map the data
--- file has an entry for (a modded/fan-hack map, or simply not Gen 3) --
--- nil means "say nothing", so the caller keeps whatever the un-patched
--- engine function already answered.

-- table back (that is what `require` caching means), so one patch here
