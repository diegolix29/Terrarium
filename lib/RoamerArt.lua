-- Overworld art for a wild Pokemon.
--
-- Gen 1 draws no Pokemon on the map.  Eleven species have an overworld
-- sheet because a script stands one somewhere (the Vermilion Machop, the
-- Snorlax, Bill's Pikachu); the other hundred and forty have exactly one
-- drawing each and it is the battle FRONT pic.
--
-- Resampling a 40x40 front pic into a 16x16 cell is what this file first
-- did, and it is what made Sandshrew look like Charmander and Growlithe
-- into an unreadable blob: a battle portrait is drawn to read at battle
-- size, not as a walk-cycle tile.  So the preferred path is a Gen-2-style
-- 16x96 walker sheet at:
--
--   assets/roamers/<SPECIES>.png
--
-- Those sheets are NOT in the repository. Same rule as the X/Y GUI pack:
-- crediting ShockSlayer / Crystal Clear / PokePC Followers is not holding a
-- licence from them. tools/install_roamer_sprites.py fetches the pack and
-- renames it into place; assets/roamers/CREDITS.md is the install note.
-- Shipped sheets are marked `trueColor` so the OBP bake and the zone shader
-- leave the species colours alone (VoxelScene already respects that flag).
--
-- When a sheet is missing, the front-pic bake is the FALLBACK: a greyscale
-- 16x96 under save/mod-derived/<id>/roamers/, revisioned so an old cut is
-- never mistaken for a new one. The bake is what players without the pack
-- see -- so its outline bias and size floor matter, and they are tuned for
-- recognition rather than for a perfect miniature of the battle portrait.
--
-- Drop a replacement at assets/roamers/<SPECIES>.png and nothing is generated
-- for that species.
