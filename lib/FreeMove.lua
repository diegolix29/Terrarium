-- Voxel world mode: free movement for the free-roam rungs.
--
-- The engine walks a grid: sixteen frames per cell, four directions,
-- input locked mid-step. Inside a camera that stands with the player that
-- gait reads as riding a rail, so while 1ST or 3RD drives, this module
-- replaces the WALK and nothing else: the player's position becomes
-- continuous, steered by the camera's own yaw -- push forward and you go
-- where you look, at any angle, sliding along whatever you graze.
--
-- Both rungs walk identically: the boom behind the shoulder (3RD) changes
-- where the eye stands, not which way it points, and the walk was always
-- rotated by the YAW. The one thing it does change is which way the body
-- POINTS while it moves -- see bodyFacing in the tick.
--
-- THE GRID IS STILL THE GAME. Every fact the world cares about is a fact
-- about cells -- what blocks, what warps, what rustles, what bites -- and
-- this module keeps the player's logical cell synced to wherever the free
-- walk stands, then reuses the engine's own machinery for every one of
-- those questions:
--
--   passability      Collision.mayEnter -- the grid walker's own verdict,
--                    whole, asked per cell the player's body overlaps:
--                    side walls, bounds, passability, ELEVATION, acro
--                    tiles and rails, tile pairs, occupancy. Asked, not
--                    restated; a copy of it here lost three of the seven.
--
--   the forced moves the eddy that spins you back out (Gen 2's
--                    whirlpool) is asked once per moving frame, before the
--                    slide covers ground, because it is not a refusal the
--                    body can clamp against -- an eddy reads as plain
--                    water. Once it fires the engine's spin owns the
--                    player and this module stands aside.
--
--   cell arrival     OverworldState:onStepComplete, the same landing
--                    pipeline a grid step runs -- warps, spinners, gates,
--                    forced currents, poison, repel, encounters, the
--                    step counters -- fired once per cell crossed, which
--                    is exactly the rate a grid walk fires it.
--
--   the special pushes   walking out of a door, off the map edge, into a
--                    ledge, or into a boulder hands the quantised
--                    direction straight to checkGen2CarpetExit /
--                    checkGen3ArrowWarp / checkEdgeExit / checkLedgeHop /
--                    checkBoulderPush, the engine's own handlers, which
--                    validate and stage everything themselves (the mat's
--                    own direction, connections, the hop arc, the
--                    two-push arm). While any of those animates a
--                    scripted grid move, this module stands aside and
--                    adopts the result.
--
-- Nothing here writes save state, rolls encounters, or decides what a
-- warp does -- it moves a point, keeps the cell honest, and lets the
-- engine be the engine. Stepping off the rung snaps the point to its
-- cell and hands the walk back to the grid, and with the rung off this
-- module costs one gate check per frame.

-- ------- the per-cell verdict
--
-- The same questions Collision.canMove asks for a grid step, asked of one
-- cell from the player's current standing. The player's OWN cell never
-- blocks -- the body must always be free to leave wherever it stands
-- (a warp mat, the water it is surfing, a cell an NPC just stepped
-- against).

-- ASK THE ENGINE. DO NOT RESTATE IT.
--
-- MOTIVATED BY THE CLIFF BESIDE ROUTE 114'S METEOR FALLS MOUTH (the seam
-- between (14,52) at elevation 3 and (14,53) at elevation 4), which the free
-- walk strolled up.  Reported from play: "when using first and third person
-- into caves im getting an issue where it makes me move on top of the cliff
-- instead of going into the cave entrance. shouldnt be able to climb on top
-- of cliffs either in first or third person".
--
-- This function used to spell the step test out again, and it got FOUR of the
-- engine's SEVEN clauses.  Collision's own `verdict` applies, in order: the
-- one-way side walls, the bounds, the passability (with the surfing
-- exception), the ELEVATION (with the coming-ashore exception), the acro
-- tiles and the rail under the rider, the tile pairs, and the occupancy.  The
-- copy here had bounds, passability, tile pairs and occupancy -- and no side
-- walls, no elevation and no acro.
--
-- Elevation is the one that showed.  In Hoenn the sea is passable ground at
-- elevation 1 and dry land is 3; a cliff top and its foot are two elevations
-- with nothing solid between them, which is the whole of "you cannot walk
-- onto water", "you cannot step off a cliff" and "the bridge and the river
-- beneath it are different places".  Measured over the region: 4,376 cliff
-- steps and 3,704 water steps across 107 maps that the grid walk refuses with
-- reason "elevation" and this function waved through -- including walking off
-- a beach onto the open sea, on foot, without surfing.
--
-- So it no longer has an opinion.  Collision.mayEnter is canMove asked about
-- a cell you name instead of a direction you take, and it runs the same
-- verdict through the same movement.collision hook -- which the restatement
-- also skipped, so a mod that overrode collision was obeyed on the grid and
-- ignored in first person.  Anything added to that verdict later is now the
-- free walk's too, which is the actual repair: this is the third bug in a row
-- from restating the engine rather than calling it.
--
-- `dir` is the AXIS being crossed, handed down by slideX/slideZ, because the
-- cell asked about can be DIAGONAL from the player -- a body with a radius
-- overlaps two cells per axis while it slides along anything. East is east
-- through that boundary whichever row the cell is in, which is the reading
-- the two direction-keyed clauses (the side walls, the rail) want.
--
-- The player's OWN cell still never blocks, and that exemption matters more
-- now than it did: with elevation live, a body standing on a cell whose
-- elevation disagrees with p.elevation -- a script placed them, a warp landed
-- them -- must still be free to walk off it rather than be frozen where it
-- stands.  (p.elevation itself is kept current by the engine: setMap writes
-- it on entry and onStepComplete re-derives it on every cell crossed, which
-- this module calls on every cell it crosses.  A nil elevation blocks
-- nothing, so a mover that somehow has none walks exactly as before.)
--
-- Returns the engine's own reason -- "bounds" | "tile" | "entity" |
-- "elevation" -- or nil when the body may enter.  The extra name is passed
-- through rather than folded into "tile" because it is the engine's word for
-- it, and the blocked-push block below already treats it the way the grid
-- walk does: not an entity, so the door and ledge verbs are still offered it.

-- ------- the blocked push
--
-- The grid game's blocked step is where half its verbs live: the map-edge
-- crossing, the ledge hop, the boulder shove, and the route-gate warp
-- fired by collision. Hand the engine the quantised direction and let its
-- own handlers decide -- each one validates itself (checkLedgeHop matches
-- the tile pair, checkEdgeExit checks the bounds), so calling them on
-- every firm push is safe. Returns true when one of them took the frame
-- over.
--
-- The one verb NOT restated here is the bonk. On the grid a blocked step
-- is a discrete event -- you pressed a direction, the game refused, and
-- the bump answers you once. A free walk has no such moment: the body
-- SLIDES along whatever it grazes, so a player walking a fence line or
-- rounding a doorframe is blocked on one axis continuously, and the same
-- sound comes out as a rattle for as long as they keep walking. It is
-- feedback for a refusal that is not happening. The grid walk keeps its
-- own bump (the engine's, in OverworldController) untouched.

  -- A DOORMAT IS A VERB, AND IT WAS THE ONE VERB THIS LIST LEFT OUT.
  --
  -- MOTIVATED BY CHERRYGROVE CITY'S POKEMON CENTER -- AND EVERY OTHER
  -- CENTER, MART, GYM AND HOUSE IN JOHTO -- WHOSE EXIT MAT THE FREE WALK
  -- COULD STAND ON FOREVER.  Reported from play: "first and third person not
  -- able to exit buildings in gen2".
  --
  -- The list below restates the grid walk's blocked-step verbs, and it
  -- restated three of the five.  On the grid (OverworldController:handleInput,
  -- the held-direction loop) the order is:
  --
  --     checkGen2CarpetExit -> checkGen3ArrowWarp -> checkEdgeExit
  --     -> checkLedgeHop -> checkBoulderPush
  --
  -- and the first two are exactly the ones a DIRECTIONAL EXIT MAT answers to.
  -- Nothing else will: on a Gen 2 carpet ($70/$76/$78/$7E) and a Gen 3 arrow
  -- warp ($62..$65, $6D) all three of the other ways out are shut, by design
  -- and not by accident --
  --
  --   * Warp.onArrive REFUSES the mat.  That is CheckDirectionalWarp, and it
  --     is what stops a two-cell mat from being a trapdoor you fall through
  --     by taking one step ALONG it (Warp.lua:45-50).  It must stay refused.
  --   * checkEdgeExit and the blocked-step Warp.onCollision below are both
  --     gated on canCollisionWarp, and refreshStandingOnWarp clears
  --     standingOnWarp for precisely these cells -- a mat is a warp tile and
  --     is not a door tile -- so the gate is FALSE on every mat in the game
  --     (OverworldController.lua:3208-3211 says so in as many words).
  --   * there is no completed step to qualify either, because the cell the
  --     mat points at is the doorway: off the map, or a wall.
  --
  -- So the free walk pushed south on the mat, was clamped flush against the
  -- map edge, ran this function every frame, and got false from all three --
  -- while the grid walk on the identical cell, with standingOnWarp equally
  -- false, walked out on the first frame through the two calls that were
  -- missing here.  Gen 1 was never affected: its mat is a DOOR tile, which
  -- keeps standingOnWarp set, so checkEdgeExit already answered for it.
  --
  -- Both of these self-gate -- checkGen2CarpetExit returns false off Gen 2,
  -- checkGen3ArrowWarp returns false on a map with no arrow warps -- so they
  -- are safe to ask on every firm push, which is the same contract the three
  -- below already keep.  They go FIRST, in the grid walk's own order: the
  -- engine puts checkGen3ArrowWarp ahead of checkEdgeExit deliberately
  -- (OverworldController.lua:3719-3724), and a mat whose front is off the map
  -- would otherwise be answered by the edge path instead of the door.

  --
  -- The doormat verbs below live in pushSpecials because a doormat is a
  -- REFUSED step: the mat's front is a wall or off the map, the body clamps,
  -- and the push is the event.  An eddy is the opposite.  CollisionPermission-
  -- Table (3E:$74BE) gives COLL_WHIRLPOOL ($24/$2C) the byte $11, whose low
  -- nibble GetTileCollision keeps -- so the eddy reads as PLAIN WATER, .TrySurf
  -- does not refuse it, Collision.canMove says yes, and blockedCell therefore
  -- returns nil.  There is no clamp, no `hit`, and pushSpecials never runs at
  -- all.  Measured on a Gen 2 pond: the free walk crossed into the eddy cell
  -- on frame 8 and was still sitting in it on frame 22, with checkGen2Whirl-
  -- pool never once asked, while the grid walk on the identical cell started
  -- the spin on frame 1.
  --
  -- So it belongs HERE, on the allowed-movement path, before the slide covers
  -- any ground.  That is also where the grid walk keeps it: handleInput asks
  -- it at the TOP of the held-direction loop, outside and ahead of the
  -- `not p.moving and p.facing == dir` guard, because ".Normal and .Surf both
  -- `call .CheckTile` straight after .GetAction and `ret c`, so the eddy
  -- pre-empts turning, stepping, ledges and warps alike".  Asking it after the
  -- slide would let the body enter the current before being spun out of it,
  -- and standing IN an eddy is the softlock the eddy-as-a-bump exists to
  -- avoid.
  --
  -- The direction is the quantised TRAVEL bearing -- the same dominant-axis
